stat screen bugs out, likely because there are no stats. Fix this: stats should look fine even if they are empty and make up fake stats so I can see it working
does voice system default really exist, if not remove it
button on top right does not do anything, remove it
dont display home text, just the button logo on top left
remove staring sentences, instead next just selects random from current level
first page should not be the "no tracked sequences" text. Instead it should display "activity this week" with options to go next with level rolldown option
keep current_level as a global variable, can change it in home/or sentence page, then next, will select random from that level
hsk4 sentences have numerical pinyin, because the data was not well generated. Change the prompt so pinying shows properly, and fix the hsk 4 data
read scoring.md. Refactor and simpify current workflow for scoring. I need you to score AFTER recording, not in parallel, simplify the codebase
Then, make an implementation plan from scoring.md
